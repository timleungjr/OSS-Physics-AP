\section{Course Material}
No textbook is required. Presentation slides, handouts and homework sets are
downloadable from the school website; students are expected to download them
prior to class. Please have a pen/pencil (or tablet for online classes) for
note-taking, and a scientific calculator for working out in-class example
problems.



%\section{Course Pre-requisites}
%When taking this course, you should be familiar with the physics units of
%\begin{itemize}[nosep]
%\item Grade 10 Science (optics)
%\item Grade 8 Science (forces)
%\end{itemize}
%as well as topics in math including: functions, basic trigonometry



\section{Homework}
Homework questions are assigned for every class based on the topics covered.
There are usually 15 to 20 questions, consisting of multiple-choice and
AP-style ``free-response'' questions. The questions are based on
university-level problems, as well as past AP and IB exams. Homework sets are
posted on the school's website as well as on \texttt{classkick.com}, and
normally due at the end of the following class. Homework questions will
\emph{not} be reviewed in their during class time. Instead, links to additional
homework take-up videos are posted on the school's website regularly.
%homework take-up tutorial on Monday nights (see Section~\ref{tutorial}).


\section{Tests}
There are \underline{two} in-class practice tests for assessment:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item A \textbf{mechanic} test on Class 13, covering mechanics topics from
  Classes 1 to 12.
\item An \textbf{electricity and magnetism} test on Class 24 (last day),
  covering material from Classes 14 to 23.
\end{itemize}




%\section{Online Tutorial}
%\label{tutorial}
%In addition to the regular class time, there is a drop-in tutorial session
%(shared with Physics 11 students) for students to ask course-related questions.
%%There are two online tutorials. Homework questions from the previous class will
%%be taken-up during the Monday session, while the Thursday evening drop-in
%%sessions is for students to ask questions.
%Zoom link for the tutorial can be found in the student account.

%\section{Academic Integrity}
%Meritus Academy values academic integrity. Students are encouraged to complete
%their homework and tests using knowledge gained from class. Handing in work
%that are copied from the internet, or generated by AI is not allowed. If a
%student is suspected to have copied, cheated or plagiarized, they will be
%temporarily assigned a 0\% or incomplete, and the issue will be brought to the
%school administration.


%\section{Homework Standard}
%\begin{itemize}
%\item You do not need to show work for multiple-choice questions. For online
%  classes, please answer them directly on selection box on Classkick. For
%  in-person classes, simply circle the correct letter.
%\item For problem-solving questions, you must show \emph{all} work by providing
%  complete and organized steps.
%  \begin{itemize}[nosep]
%  \item Always write out the relevant equations \emph{before} substituting
%    numerical values
%  \item If you introduce any new variables, explain what they are
%  \item Draw diagrams whenever necessary, or whenever it helps to explain your
%    work
%  \item Only use standard variable names in you calculations (e.g.\ when
%    calculating speed, always use $v$ instead of ``$X$'')
%  \item Show all algebraic steps and numerical calculations
%  \item Circle or box all your final answers
%  \item Proper math format must be observed (e.g.\ proper use of ``='' sign,
%    units, etc.)
%  \end{itemize}
%  In short, answer the questions as if the reader is learning the concept from
%  you, not as if they already understands it.
%\item If a question requires you to \emph{explain}, please do so using short
%  complete sentences with supporting detail. There is no need to write full
%  paragraphs.
%\end{itemize}

\section{Classroom Expectations (Online)}
Students attending this course will be expected to:
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item Log into the Zoom meeting a few minutes before the start of the class
\item Have your full name displayed on the screen
\item Have your camera turned on showing your face
\item Be ready to learn and participate during class
\item Type in all your in-class questions and comments into the Zoom chat
  window. Don't wait too long before you ask a question; the longer you wait,
  the less effective it will be to answer your questions
\item Be \emph{specific} with your questions. As skilled as the teachers are,
  vague statements and questions like ``I don't understand, can you explain it
  again'' are impossible to answer
\item Please inform your teacher if you have to leave the class early for
  whatever reason
\item Be respectful to yourself, your teacher, and your fellow students. You
  are expected to act maturely and responsibly
\end{itemize}



\section{Homework Expectation}
\begin{itemize}[nosep]
\item For multiple-choice questions, please answer them directly on the web
  interface on \texttt{classkick.com} %, which is the online platform that
  %Meritus uses for homework submissions.
\item For free-response questions:
  \begin{itemize}[nosep]
  \item Show \emph{all} work by providing complete and organized steps. In
    \emph{all} AP exams, only part marks are awarded for the correct answer;
    most of the marks are for applying the correct concepts and showing your
    diligent work.
  \item If a question requires you to \emph{explain} or \emph{justify} your
    answers, do so using \underline{short} complete sentences with sufficient
    supporting detail. There is no need/reason to write long paragraphs; you
    will not have enough time during an exam, and it will not add value to
    your work.
  \item Proper math format must be used, e.g.\ proper use of ``='' sign, units,
    etc.
  \item Circle or box all your final answers for clarity.
  \end{itemize}
\item Late homework is always accepted. However, the longer you wait, the less
  meaningful they will be for your learning.
%\item Some of the questions will be taken up during class. However, this does
%  \emph{not} mean you don't need to do your homework at home. Always do your
%  best.
\end{itemize}

%\section{Tests}
%There are three practice tests in the course. They roughly follow the format
%for AP exams, with multiple-choice questions and free-response questions.
%\begin{itemize}[nosep]
%\item A take-home practice test for Class 8. This test covers material from the
%  the first 7 classes (kinematics and dynamics)
%\item A take-home practice test during Class 13. This test covers material from
%  the entire course, but with emphasis on the material from Classes 8 to 12
%  (work and energy)
%\item An in-class practice test during Class 16. This test covers all material
%  in the course, but with emphasis on topics in Classes 11 to 15 (circular
%  motion, gravity, rotational motion and harmonic motion)
%\end{itemize}
