  \frametitle{Making Amp\`{e}re's Law Better}

  Amp\`{e}re's law, as we know it, only applied to \emph{steady} currents:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \oint_C \mb{B}\cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell}=\mu_0 I
  }

  But current are not always steady in $RC$ circuits. Applying Amp\`{e}re's law
  at a charging/discharging capacitor gives an ambiguous answer

  Four surfaces bounded by the same circular amperian loop (think blowing a
  soap bubble). Surfaces \numlist{1;2;4} have currents penetrating through
  them, but surface \num{3} does not

  This might give a better view of what the ``soap bubble'' looks like
  \begin{center}
    \pic{.5}{bubble.png}
  \end{center}
  There is no current through the surface $A_2$ (same as surface \num{3} in the
  last slide), but there is definitely a changing \emph{electric flux}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Maxwell's Modification to Amp\`{e}re's Law}
  James Clerk Maxwell, in 1860, proposed a modification to Amp\`{e}re's Law
  to make it work with unsteady current as well

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      \oint\mb{B}\cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell}=\mu_0 I +
      \mu_0\varepsilon_0 \frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}
    }
  }

  Maxwell called the correction term
  $\displaystyle \varepsilon_0\frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}$ ``displacement current''.
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The word ``displacement'' has historical roots, but no real physical
    meaning
  \item However, ``current'' means that the effect of changing the electric
    flux is indistinguishable from real currents in producing magnetic field
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

  \frametitle{Maxwell's Equations}
  Maxwell recognized the relationship between electricity and
  magnetism in \textbf{Gauss's law}, \textbf{Faraday's law} and
  \textbf{Amp\`{e}re's law}, and combined them into a unifying set of
  equations, now known as \textbf{Maxwell's equations} for electrodynamics.
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Maxwell's Equations in Integral Form}
  Maxwell's equations can be expressed in its integral form, which is how we
  have studied the equations in the first place:

  {\Large
    \begin{align*}
      \oint\mb{E}\cdot d\mb{A} &=\frac{q}{\varepsilon_0} &
      \text{\normalsize (Gauss, for $\mb{E}$)}\\
      \oint\mb{B}\cdot d\mb{A} &= 0 &
      \text{\normalsize (Gauss, for $\mb{B}$)}\\
      \oint\mb{E}\cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} &=\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} &
      \text{\normalsize (Faraday)}\\
      \oint\mb{B}\cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell} &
      =\mu_0I+\mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{d\Phi_E}{dt} &
      \text{\normalsize (Amp\`{e}re, with Maxwell's mod)}
    \end{align*}
  }
\end{frame}

        \oint\mb{E}\cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell}&=\frac{d\Phi_B}{dt} \\
        \oint\mb{B}\cdot d\boldsymbol{\ell}&=\mu_0\epsilon_0\frac{d\Phi_E}{dt}\\
      \end{align*}
    }

    \column{.65\textwidth}
    In vacuum, we can remove all references to matter in the equation, and
    Maxwell's equations simplifies.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The equations show ``symmetry''
    \item Magnetic and electric fields are on equal footing
    \item In a vacuum where charges are currents are absent, the only source of
      either field is a change in the other field
    \end{itemize}

    \begin{itemize}
    \item Usually Maxwell's equations are expressed in \emph{differential} form,
      which is obtained using vector calculus. Follow
      [\underline{\href{https://www.wikihow.com/Convert-Maxwell\%27s-Equations-into-Differential-Form}{this link}}]
      to see how it's done.
    \item The differential form gives a clear picture of how the \emph{time}
      rate of change of $\mb{E}$ and $\mb{B}$ are related to the \emph{spatial}
      rate of change of the other field
    \item The last two equations (Faraday's law and Amp\`{e}re's law) together
      represent two set of second order partial differential equations (one for
      each field), the solution of which represents a traveling wave

  \frametitle{Electromagnetic (EM) Wave}
  We can manipulate Maxwell's equations to show that an ``electromagnetic
  wave'' must exist. A simple case where electric and magnetic fields vary in
  $x$ and time $t$ only, i.e.\ $\mb{E}=\mb{E}(x,t)$ and $\mb{B}=\mb{B}(x,t)$,
  Faraday's and Amp\`{e}re's laws reduce to:

  \eq{-.2in}{
    \frac{\partial E}{\partial x}=-\frac{\partial B}{dt}
    \quad\quad
    \frac{\partial B}{\partial x}=-\mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial E}{dt}
  }

  Taking the spatial derivative of $E$ with respect to $x$ on both
  side of Faraday's law, we get:

  \eq{-.3in}{
      \frac{\partial}{\partial x}
      \left(\frac{\partial E}{\partial x}\right)
      =-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left(\frac{\partial B}{dt}\right)
      \quad\rightarrow\quad
      \frac{\partial^2E}{\partial x^2}=
      -\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial B}{dx}\right)
  }
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Electromagnetic (EM) Wave}
  But we already have an expression for $\partial B/\partial x$ from
  Amp\`{e}re's law:

  \eq{-.2in}{
    \frac{\partial^2E}{\partial x^2}=
    -\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\frac{\partial B}{dx}\right)
    =-\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(
    -\mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial E}{dt}
    \right)
  }

  Rearranging the terms on the right hand side, we get

  \eq{-.2in}{
    \frac{\partial^2E}{\partial x^2}=
    \mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial^2 E}{dt^2}
  }
  
  Compare this to the standard form of the one-dimensional wave equation (a
  second-order partial differential equation):

  \eq{-.2in}{
    \frac{\partial^2\Psi}{\partial x^2}=
    \frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial^2\Psi}{dt^2}
  }
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Electromagnetic (EM) Wave}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item ``Second-order'' means that the equation deals with second derivatives,
    in this case, in $x$ and in $t$.
  \item ``Partial'' means the equation involves partial derivatives, which is
    the derivative you take when the function is made of more than one
    variables, and you are only differentiating against one variable
  \item We can also repeat the exercise by first differentiating Amp\`{e}re's
    law to get

    \eq{-.2in}{
      \frac{\partial^2 B}{\partial x^2}=
      \mu_0\varepsilon_0\frac{\partial^2 B}{dt^2}
    }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}
\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Electromagnetic (EM) Wave}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The wave equation shows that disturbances in electric and magnetic
    fields propagate as an electromagnetic wave with a universal speed

    \eq{-.2in}{
      v=c_0=\frac{1}{\sqrt{\mu_0\varepsilon_0}}=\SI{299792458}{m/s}
    }

    generally referred to as the speed of light.

  \item Our simple exercise can't show (because we have effectively ignored
    the cross-product) that $\mb{E}$ and $\mb{B}$ are actually perpendicular
    to each other
  \end{itemize}

  \frametitle{``Failure'' of Maxwell's Equation}
  A peculiar feature of Maxwell's equation:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When applying \emph{Galilean transformation} (our classical equation for
    \emph{relative velocity}) to these equations, they seem to fail 
  \item Gauss's law for magnetism break down: magnetic field lines appear to
    have beginnings/ends
  \item So does that mean that in \emph{some} inertial frames of reference,
    Maxwell's equations are valid, but in others, they are not?
  \item Physicists theorized that, perhaps, there is/are actually
    \emph{preferred} inertial frame(s) of references
  \item This violate the long-standing
    \emph{principle of relativity}, which says that
    \emph{the laws of physics are equal in all inertial frames of reference}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Making The Equations Work Again}
  Maxwell's equations didn't ``fail''; it was our understanding of space and
  time that needed to change
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Albert Einstein believed in the principle of relativity, and rejected
    the concept of a preferred frame of reference
  \item In Maxwell's equations, the speed of an electromagnetic wave (speed of
    light) is independent of the frame of reference
  \item In order to make the equations to work again, Einstein revisited the
    most basic concepts involved in our understanding of physics: space and
    time
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}
  \frametitle{Einstein and the Principle of Relativity}
  Einstein's Postulates of Special Relativity:
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item All laws of physics must apply equally in all inertial frames of
    reference.
  \item As measured in any inertial frame of reference, light always propagated
    empty space with a definite velocity $c$ that is independent of the state
    of motion of the emitting body.
  \end{enumerate}

  \emph{On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies} when Einstein was 26 years old
