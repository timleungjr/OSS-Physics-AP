\textbf{Directions:} Answer all questions. The suggested time is about 15
minutes for answering each of the questions, which are worth 15 points each.
The parts within a question may not have equal weight. All final numerical
answers should include appropriate units. Credit depends on the quality of your
solutions and explanations, so you should show your work. Credit also depends
on demonstrating that you know which physical principles would be appropriate
to apply in a particular situation. Therefore, you should clearly indicate
which part of a question your work is for.
