\section{Projectile Motion}

%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item For 2D problems, resolve the problem into its
%    horizontal ($x$) and vertical ($y$) directions, and apply kinematic
%    equations independently
For projectile motion, there is no acceleration in the horizontal
($\bm{\hat{\imath}}$) direction, i.e.\ $a_x=0$. Therefore the kinematic
equations is reduced to a single equation
\begin{equation}
  x-x_0=v_xt
\end{equation}
It is customary to define the $\bm{\hat{\imath}}$ direction to be the forward
horizontal direction.

The only acceleration is due to gravity in the vertical ($\bm{\hat{\jmath}}$)
direction. In the standard Cartesian coordinate system, $\bm{\hat{\jmath}}$ is
direction is therefore usually \emph{up}, and the acceleration due to gravity is
\begin{equation}
  a_y=-g
\end{equation}
%\begin{multicols}{2}
The kinematic equation are reduced to:
\begin{align}
  v_y&=v_{y0}-gt\\
  y&=y_0+v_{y0}t-\frac12 gt^2\label{eq:needthis}\\
  v_y^2&=v_{y0}^2-2g(y-y_o)
\end{align}
In general, only Eq.~\ref{eq:needthis} is needed to solve projectile motion
problems.
%\end{multicols}
%The variable that connects the two directions is time $t$.

\section{Symmetric Trajectory}

A \textbf{symmetric trajectory} is a special case of projectile motion where an
object is launched at an angle of $\theta$ (between \ang{0} and \ang{90}) above
the horizontal\footnote{This may be obvious, but angles \emph{below} the 
  horizontal will never have a symmetric trajectory.} with an initial velocity
$\mb{v}_0$, and then lands at the same height, as shown below in Fig.~\ref{sym}.
Examples may include hitting a golf ball toward the hole, or shooting a bullet
toward a horizontal target\footnote{Shooting a bullet toward a horizontal
  target always require an upward angle because of gravity.}. The equations for
symmetric trajectory are \emph{not} included in the AP Exam equation sheet; if
you need these equations during the exams, you will need to derive them
yourself. Thankfully, the derivation is quite striaght forward. To derive the
equations, we use the $x$-axis for the horizontal direction and $y$-axis for
the vertical.

\end{figure}

The initial velocity $\mb{v}_0$ can be resolved into its $\iii$ and $\jjj$
components, also shown in Fig.~\ref{sym}:
\begin{equation}
  \mb{v}_0
  =v_x\iii+v_{y0}\jjj
  =v_0\cos\theta\iii + v_0\sin\theta\jjj
\end{equation}
The $x$ component of velocity $\mb{v}_x$ remains constant during the motion, as
there are no forces acting in the $x$ direction (as long as air resistance can
be ignored), and therefore no acceleration. In the $y$ direction, acceleration
is due to gravity alone, $a_y=-g$.

\textbf{Maximum height} $H$: Apply the kinematic equation in the $y$-direction.
Recognizing that at maximum height $H=y-y_0$, the vertical component of
velocity is zero $v_y=0$:
\begin{align*}
  v_y^2 &= v_{y0}^2 + 2a_y(y-y_0)\\
  0  &= (v_0\sin\theta)^2-2gH
\end{align*}
Solving for $H$, we get the maximum height equation:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{H=\frac{v_0^2\sin^2\theta}{2g}}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Total time of flight} $t_\mathrm{max}$: We apply the kinematic equation
in the $y$ direction. When the object lands at the same height, the final
velocity is the same in magnitude and opposite in direction as the initial
velocity, i.e.\  $v_{y2}=-v_{y1}=-v_0\sin\theta$:
\begin{align*}
  v_y &=v_{y0}+a_yt\\
  -v_0\sin\theta &=v_0\sin\theta -g t_\mathrm{max}
\end{align*}
Solving for $t_{\text{max}}$ we have:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{t_{\text{max}}=\frac{2v_0\sin\theta}{g}}
  \label{tmax}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Range} $R$: We substitute the expression for $t_{\text{max}}$ from
Eq.~\ref{tmax} into the $t$ term, then apply the kinematic equation in
the $x$-direction to compute $R=x-x_0$ for any given launch angle and initial
speed:
\begin{align*}
  x&=x_0+v_xt\\
  R &=v_0\cos\theta\left(\frac{2v_0\sin\theta}{g}\right)
\end{align*}
Using the trigonometric identity $\sin(2\theta)=2\sin\theta\cos\theta$, we
simplify the equation to:
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{R=\frac{v_0^2\sin(2\theta)}{g}}
\end{equation}
It is obvious that for any given initial speed $v_0$, the maximum range
$R_{\text{max}}$ occurs at an angle where $\sin(2\theta)=1$
(i.e.\ $\theta=\pi/4$), with a value of
\begin{equation}
  \boxed{R_\mathrm{max}=\frac{v_0^2}{g}}
\end{equation}
Also, for a known initial speed $v_0$ and range $R$ we can compute the launch
angle $\theta$:
\begin{displaymath}
  \theta_1=\frac{1}{2}\sin^{-1}\left(\frac{gR}{v_0^2}\right)
\end{displaymath}
This angle is labelled $\theta_1$ because it is \emph{not} the only angle that
can reach this range. Recall that for any angle $0<\phi<\pi/2$, there
is also another angle $\phi_2$ where $\sin(\phi)$ value is the same:
\begin{displaymath}
  \sin\phi=\sin(\pi-\phi)
\end{displaymath}
Which means that for any $\theta_1$, there is also another angle
$\theta_2$ where $2\theta_2=\pi-2\theta_1$, or quite simply:
\begin{displaymath}
  \theta_2=\frac{\pi}{2}-\theta_1
\end{displaymath}
