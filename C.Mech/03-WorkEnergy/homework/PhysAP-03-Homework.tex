%  \item What is the speed of the bullet before it hits $M$?

%  \item What is the tension in the string at the highest point of the pendulum's
%    swing (when the string makes an angle of $\theta$ with the vertical as

%\item Two masses are connected by a spring (spring constant $k$) resting on a
%  frictionless horizontal surface as shown. The right mass is initially in
%  contact with a wall. A brief blow to the left block leaves it with an initial
%  velocity $v_0$ to the right.
%  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt]
%  \item What is the maximum compression of the spring as the left block moves
%    to the right?
%    \vspace{1in}
%  \end{enumerate}
%  After the spring is maximally compressed, it eventually moves to the left,
%  away from wall. As it moves away from the wall, it continues oscillating.

%  \item What is the net momentum of the two masses after they leave the wall?
%    \vspace{1in}
%  \item What is the total mechanical energy of the oscillating spring system?
%    \vspace{1in}
%  \item What is the relative velocity of the two masses when the spring is
%    maximally compressed?
%    \vspace{1in}
%  \item What is the maximum compression of the spring after the two masses have
%    left the wall? Compare the compression to the maximum compression calculated
%    in part (a) and explain any similarities and differences.
