\item A lead box containing radioactive materials that emit both electrons and
  positrons is placed near an apparatus consisting of an evacuated capacitor
  that is filled with a magnetic field, as shown in the figure. Electrons that
  enter along the center line of the capacitor plates travel straight through
  (undeflected) with a velocity of $v=\SI{1.0e7}{m/s}$ and out
  the hole in the center of the apparatus on the right. The capacitor plates
  are separated by a distance of $d=\SI{0.020}{\metre}$; each plate has an area
  of $A=\SI{1.0e-4}{m^2}$ and a potential difference of $\Delta V$. A uniform
  magnetic field of $B=\SI{0.030}{\tesla}$ is directed out of the page between
  the plates, as shown in the figure.
