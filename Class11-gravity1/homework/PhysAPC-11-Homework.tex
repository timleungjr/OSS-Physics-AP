%    surface of Mars), would the new orbital period of the GS be greater than or
%    less than the given period? Justify your answer.

%\item\textbf{THIS IS A CHALLENGE PROBLEM THAT IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN AP EXAMS:}
%  Spacecraft that study the Sun are often placed at the ``L1 Lagrange Point'',
%  located sunward of Earth on the Sun--Earth line. L1 is the point where Earth's
%  and Sun's gravity together produce an orbital period of one year, so that a
%  spacecraft at L1 stays fixed relative to Earth as both planet and spacecraft
%  orbit the Sun. This placement ensures an uninterrupted view of the sun,
%  without being periodically eclipsed by Earth as would occur in Earth orbit.
%  Find L1's location relative to Earth. (Hint: This problem calls for numerical
%  methods for solving high-order polynomial equation.)
