\item An air bubble is released from the bottom of a swimming pool and
  ascends to the surface.
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt]
  \item In a clear, coherent, paragraph-length response, describe any
    changes in the bubble size and describe the motion of the bubble
    as it ascends to the surface. Explain the factors that affect the size
    of the bubble and the bubble's motion. Include a description of
    any forces acting on the bubble from the time it is at the bottom of
    the pool until it reaches the surface.
    \vspace{1.75in}
    
  \item Draw a diagram of all the forces acting on the bubble. Make sure
    the forces are in correct proportion.
    \vspace{1.75in}

  \item The bubble does not collapse under the pressure of the water.
    Explain how the behavior of the gas atoms keep the bubble from
    collapsing.
    \newpage
    %\vspace{1.5in}
    
  \item The bubble has an initial volume of $V_D$ , begins at a depth of $D$
    below the surface of the water, and reaches the surface where the
    pressure is $P_S$ . The density of the water is $r$.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item  Derive an expression for the initial pressure ($P_D$) in the bubble
      in terms of the given quantities and known constants.
    \item Assume the air temperature in the bubble remains the same as
      it rises. Derive an expression for the volume ($V_S$) of the bubble
      when it reaches the surface.
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{2in}
    
  \item Now assume that the bubble rises quickly to the surface, and that
    there is negligible thermal energy transfer between the bubble andthe
    swimming pool. Base your answers on this assumption.
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item Sketch the process on the PV diagram. Indicate on the axis the
      initial and final pressures and volumes.
    \item How does the value $P_S$--$V_S$ compare to the value $P_D$--$V_D$?
      %__Greater than P D V D __Equal to P D V D __Less than P D V D
      Justify your answer.
    \end{enumerate}
    \vspace{1.75in}
    
  \item The bubble passes through higher temperature water as it nears the
    sun-warmed surface of the pool. Unexpectedly, this allows a
    sizable amount of thermal energy to transfer from the water to the
    bubble as it rises. How does this affect the final volume of the
    bubble? Justify your answer.

    than the hose. If the nozzle is removed from the hose, will the
    beaker be filled faster? Justify your answer with conservation
    laws.

    at point A compare to the pressure in the fluid at the exit nozzle?
    Justify your claim.

  \item The hose is now used to fill a \SI{200}{\milli\litre} graduated
    cylinder with oil to the same height as the height of the oil in the
    \SI{1000}{\milli\litre} beaker. Compare the net force from the oil on the
    bottom of the \SI{200}{\milli\litre} cylinder and the
    \SI{1000}{\milli\litre}. Explain your answer.
    \vspace{1in}
    
  \item A cube of lead with a side dimension of \SI{5.0}{cm} is slowly lowered
    into the beaker of oil by a thin string attached to a spring scale at a
    constant rate, as shown in the figure. The density of lead is
    \SI{11300}{kg/m^3}.

    \begin{enumerate}
    \item What will be the spring scale reading in newtons when the lead has
      been submerged to location 2?
    \item Does the spring scale reading increase, decrease, or stay the
      same when the cube is lowered from location 2 to location 3?
      Justify your answer by referencing the pressure of the fluid on
      the lead cube.
    \item The lead cube is lowered from above the oil’s surface (location
      1) to a spot just below the surface (location 2) until the cube is
      just above the bottom of the beaker (location 3). Describe any
      changes in pressure on the bottom of the beaker during this
      process. Explain your answer.
