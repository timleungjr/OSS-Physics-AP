\begin{frame}{Work and Energy}
  We start with some definition at are (unfortunately) not very useful:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Energy} is the ability to do work.
    \item \textbf{Work} is the mechanism in which energy is transformed.
  \end{itemize}
  Luckily, we can also use equations to define these concepts.
\end{frame}


\section{Mechanical Work}

\begin{frame}{Mechanical Work}
  \textbf{Mechanical work} $W$ is done when a force $\vec F(\vec x)$ displaces
  an object by $\dl\vec x$. When the force moves an object along a path
  $\mathcal C$, the total work done by the force is defined as:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      W=\int_{\mathcal C}\dl W= \int_{\mathcal C}\vec F(\vec x)\cdot\dl\vec x
    }
  }

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Work is a scalar quantity
  \item Work (generally) depends on path $\mathcal C$
  \item No work done if the force is perpendicular to displacement, when
    $\vec F\cdot\dl\vec x=0$ (i.e.\ the force does not cause the displacement)
  \item No work done if there is no displacement ($\dl\vec x=\vec 0$)
  \item Work can be positive or negative depending on the dot product
  \item The SI unit for work is a \emph{joule} where
    $\SI1\joule=\SI1{\kilogram.\metre^2\per\second^2}$
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{In One Dimension}
  For motion confined to one direction in a 1D coordinate system (which is
  common for AP Physics C), the equation for work simplifies to:
  
  \eq{-.1in}{
    W=\int_{x_0}^{x_1} F(x)\dl x
  }

  (Direction still matters in 1D, i.e.\ there is still a positive and a
  negative direction.)
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Work by Constant Force}
  For a constant force, if the object moves along straight path, the integral
  simplifies to the dot product of the two vectors:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      W=\vec F\cdot\Delta\vec x
    }
  }

  We can express this also in a scalar form that is more familiar in Grades
  11/12 Physics:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      W=\vec F\Delta\vec x\cos\theta
    }
  }

  where $\theta$ is the angle between the force and displacement vectors
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Definition of Work}
  \textbf{Work done by a force}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The work done by \emph{one specific force}
  \item Example: A boy pushes a cart forward. The ``work done by the boy'' is
    the work done by the applied force
  \end{itemize}

  \vspace{.15in}\textbf{Work done on an object}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item There may be more than one force acting on an object
  \item The \emph{sum} of all the work done on the object by each force
  \item The work done by the net force
  \item Also called the \textbf{net work} $W_\text{net}$
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\section{Kinetic Energy \& Work-Energy Theorem}

\begin{frame}{Kinetic Energy}
  When a net force accelerates an object\footnote{We assume that the object has
  a constant mass}, the resulting work done on the object (net work
  $W_\text{net}$) is given by:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    W_\text{net}
    =\int_{x_0}^{x_1} F_\text{net}(x)\dl x
    =\int ma\dl x
    =m\int\diff vt\dl x
  }

  Both $v$ and $x$ are continuously differentiable in time, we can switch the
  order of differentiation:
  
  \eq{-.1in}{
    =m\int\diff xt\dl v=m\int_{v_0}^{v_1}v\dl v
  }
  where $v_0=v(x_0)$ and $v_1=v(x_1)$.
  \vspace{.3in}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Kinetic Energy}
  This integral, when integrated from $v_0$ to $v_1$, becomes:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    =m\int_{v_0}^{v_1}v\dl v
    =\frac12mv^2\Big|^{v_1}_{v_0}
    =\frac12mv_1^2-\frac12mv_0^2
    =\Delta K
  }
  
  where $K$ is defined as the \textbf{translational kinetic energy}:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      K=\frac12mv^2
    }
  }

  Later in the course we will discuss \emph{rotational} kinetic energy.
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Work-Energy Theorem}
  The \emph{definition} of kinetic energy came from this integration, in that
  work equals to the change in \emph{something}, and we define that
  \emph{something} as kinetic energy. This is the
  \textbf{work-energy theorem}\footnote{Also known as the
  \textbf{work-energy principle}}:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      W_\text{net}=\Delta K
    }
  }
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $K$ increases ($\Delta K>0$) if net work is positive ($W_\text{net}>0$),
    and
  \item $K$ decreases ($\Delta K<0$) if net work is negative ($W_\text{net}>0$)
  \item It does not matter \emph{what} the net force is composed of
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Example}
  \textbf{Example:} A force $F=4x$, measured in newtons, acts on an object of
  mass \SI2{\kilo\gram} as it moves along the $x$-axis from $x=1$ to
  $x=\SI5\metre$. Given that the object is at rest at $x=1$, calculate
  \begin{enumerate}[a.]
  \item the net work on the object
  \item the final speed of the object
  \end{enumerate}
\end{frame}



\section{Potential Energy}

\begin{frame}{Gravitational Force \& Gravitational Potential Energy}
  Consider an object that is free-falling under the force of gravity over a
  distance of $\Delta x$:
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.6]
      \draw[thick,fill=cyan!10] (7.75,0) arc (75:105:30);
      \draw[mass] (0,4) circle (.2) node[right=2.5]{$m$};
      \draw[vectors,red] (0,4)--(0,2) node[below=-1]{$\vec F_g$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When $\Delta\vec x$ is small, $\vec g$ can be considered constant
  \item The work done by the gravity ($W_g$) is \emph{positive}, and
    therefore, there is an increase in kinetic energy, and the object speeds up

    \eq{-.2in}{
      W_g=F_g\Delta x=mg\Delta x=\Delta K > 0
    }
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Gravitational Potential Energy}
  The work done by gravity can also be expressed in terms of the change in
  height. Using ground as the reference level (i.e.\ $h=0$):
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tikzpicture}[scale=.55,thick]
      \draw[fill=cyan!10] (7.75,0) arc (75:105:30);
      \draw[mass] (0,6) circle (.25);
      \draw[vectors,magenta] (0,6)--(0,3) node[midway,right]{$\Delta x$};
      \draw[->|,blue] (-.4,1)--(-.4,6) node[midway,left]{$h_0$};
      \draw[->|,blue] (0,1)--(0,3) node[midway,right]{$h_1$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}

  \vspace{-.2in}{\large
    \begin{align*}
      W_g &
      = mg{\color{magenta}\Delta x}= mg{\color{magenta}(h_0-h_1)}
      ={\color{magenta}-}mg{\color{magenta}(h_1-h_0)}\\
      &=-(mgh_1-mgh_0)= -\Delta U_g
    \end{align*}
  }
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Gravitational Potential Energy}
  Defining the \textbf{gravitational potential energy} $U_g$ as:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{U_g=mgh}\quad{\text{or}}\quad
    \boxed{\Delta U_g=mg\Delta h}
  }

  The work done by gravity is related to this potential energy by:
  
  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      W_g=-\Delta U_g
    }
  }

  \fcolorbox{black}{yellow!10}{
    \begin{minipage}{.95\textwidth}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \emph{Positive} work by gravity decreases gravitational potential
        energy, while
      \item \emph{Negative} work by gravity increases gravitational potential
        energy
      \item $W_g$ depends on the end points $h_0$ and $h_1$, but not \emph{how}
        it went from $h_0\rightarrow h_1$
      \item Only work done by gravity can affect gravitational potential energy
      \end{itemize}
    \end{minipage}
  }
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Spring Force \& Elastic Potential Energy}
  The spring force $\vec F_s$ is the force that a compressed/stretched spring
  exerts on the object connected to it.  An \emph{ideal} spring obeys Hooke's
  law:
    
  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{\vec F_s=-k\vec x}
  }

  \vspace{-.1in}The spring force acts in the opposite direction to the spring's
  displacement, and is proportional to the amount of compression/stretching.

      \draw[vectors,red] (2,1)--(3,1) node[above]{$\vec F_s$};
    \end{tikzpicture}
  \end{center}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Elastic Potential Energy}
  \vspace{-.15in}The work done by the spring force $W_s$ as it pushes any
  masses that are connected to a compressed/stretched spring is therefore:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    W_s=\int_{x_0}^{x_1}F_s\dl x =-k\int_{x_0}^{x_1} x\dl x
    =-\frac12kx^2\Big|^{x_1}_{x_0}=-\Delta U_s
  }

  where $U_s$ is the  \textbf{elastic potential energy}, defined as:
  
  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      U_s=\frac12kx^2
    }
  }
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Elastic Potential Energy}
  The the work done by the spring force can be related to the elastic
  potential energy by:
  
  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{  W_s=-\Delta U_s }
  }

  \fcolorbox{black}{yellow!10}{
    \begin{minipage}{.95\textwidth}
      \begin{itemize}
      \item \emph{Positive} work by the spring decreases spring potential
        energy, while
      \item \emph{Negative} work by the spring increases spring potential energy
      \item $W_s$ depends on the end points $x_0$ and $x_1$, but not \emph{how}
        it went from $x_0$ to $x_1$
      \item Only work done by the spring force can affect elastic potential
        energy
      \end{itemize}
    \end{minipage}
  }
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Conservative Forces}
  These forces are called \textbf{conservative forces}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Gravitational force $\vec F_g$
  \item Spring force $\vec F_s$
  \item Electrostatic force $\vec F_q$
  \item Magnetic force $\vec F_m$
  \item Nuclear forces
  \end{itemize}
  Because they shared these common properties:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item The work done by these forces relate to a change of a potential energy
    \begin{itemize}
    \item Positive work decreases this related potential energy
    \item Negative work increases this related potential energy
    \end{itemize}
  \item The work done by a conservative force is \emph{path independent}
    (depends only on end points)
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Conservative Forces}
  By the fundamental theorem of calculus, any conservative forces $\vec F$
  must be the negative gradient of the potential energies:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      \vec F=-\nabla U=
      -\diffp Ux\hat\imath-\diffp Uy\hat\jmath-\diffp Uz\hat k
    }
  }

  It is very unlikely that you will need to know the above expression in an
  AP exam, but you will need to know the one-dimension simplification:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      F=-\diff Ux
    }
  }

  The direction of a conservative force \emph{always} decreases the potential
  energy. (Pay attention to the negative sign.)
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Energy Diagrams}
  When you plot of potential energy ($U$) vs.\ position ($x$) for a
  conservative force, you get a diagram like this:
  \begin{center}

\end{frame}

%\begin{frame}{Work and Potential Energy}
%  The expressions for potential energies also come from integrating the work
%  equation, in that work equals to the change in \emph{something}, and we
%  called that potential energy. Therefore:
%
%  \eq{-.2in}{
%    \boxed{
%      W_c=-\Delta U
%    }
%  }
%  \begin{itemize}
%  \item\vspace{-.15in}$\Delta U$ can be positive or negative depending on the
%    direction of the (conservative) force
%  \item Positive work \emph{decreases} the related potential energy
%  \item Negative work \emph{increases} the related potential energy
%  \end{itemize}
%\end{frame}



%\begin{frame}{Conservation of Mechanical Energy}
%  Positive work done by conservative forces on an object does two things:
%  \begin{enumerate}[1.]
%  \item Decrease its potential energy, while
%  \item Increase its kinetic energy by the same amount
%  \end{enumerate}
%  Mathematically, this shows that mechanical energy must \emph{always} be
%  conserved when there are only conservative forces:
%
%  \eq{-.1in}{
%    W_c=-\Delta U = \Delta K \quad\longrightarrow\quad
%    \Delta K + \Delta U =0
%  }
%
%  That's why those forces are called conservative forces, and they form the
%  basis for conservation of energy.
%\end{frame}


\section{Non-Conservative Forces}

\begin{frame}{Examples of Non-Conservative Force}
  The majority of forces are \textbf{non-conservative}. The common forces
  discussed in the previous class are generally non-conservative:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Applied force
  \item Tension force
  \item Normal force
  \item Friction%\footnote{but sometimes it can also do positive work too.}
  \item Drag (fluid resistance)
  \end{itemize}
  The work-energy theorem still applies for non-conservative forces
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Work by Non-Conservative Forces}
  The work done by non-conservative forces differs from conservative forces in
  that:
  \begin{itemize}
  \item There is \textbf{no related potential energies}: the work done by a
    non-conservative force transform energy from one form of kinetic energy to
    another
  \item The work is \textbf{path dependent}
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Work by Friction, an Illustration}
  Work done by friction is illustrated below. Two blocks ($m_1$ and $m_2$),
  stacked vertically, move to the right by external force.
  % $\vec F$ applied to $m_1$.

  Therefore, work by non-conservative forces transforms energy from the kinetic
  energy of one object into the kinetic energy of another object.

  It is a function of the molecules' \textbf{absolute temperature}. This is
  part of a major field within physics called thermodynamics that is not
  covered in this course\footnote{The introductory dicussion is covered in AP
  Physics 2}; we are only including them here for completeness.\footnote{For
  those who are interested, for ideal and monatomic gases,
  $E_\text{int}=\frac32NkT$; for diatomic gases, $E_\text{int}\approx\frac52NkT$;

\section{Conservation of Energy}

\begin{frame}{Law of Conservation of Energy}
  The \textbf{law of conservation of energy} states that \emph{the change in
  the total energy of a system is equal to the external work done to it}:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      \Delta E_\text{sys}=W_\text{ext}
    }
  }

  A \textbf{system} is a predefined collection of objects that apply forces
  on each other (and may or may not do work on each other). A system can be
  \begin{itemize}
  \item\textbf{Isolated}: objects in the system do work \emph{only} on
    each other
  \item\textbf{Open}: objects in the system do work on each other as
    well as to objects in its surroundings
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Law of Conservation of Energy}
  The energy of a system includes the kinetic energies of all the objects, the
  potential energies stored between the objects, and the internal energies of
  the objects:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      E_\text{sys} = \underbrace{\sum K + \sum U_i}_\text{mechanical} +
      \underbrace{\sum E_\text{int}}_\text{thermal}
    }
  }
  
  Not suprisingly, the \emph{change} in the system enenrgy is the net change
  in all these energies:
  
  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      \Delta E_\text{sys}=\sum\Delta K + \sum\Delta U + \sum\Delta E_\text{int}
      = W_\text{ext}
    }
  }

  \vspace{-.1in}In an isolated system that does not interact with the outside
  (and therefore no external work can be done), conservation of energy reduces
  to:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{
      \sum\Delta K + \sum\Delta U + \sum\Delta E_\text{int}= 0
    }
  }
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Law of Conservation of Energy}
  In almost all of the problem encountered in AP Physics C, there will be no
  change in the internal energy of the system, and conservation of energy
  reduces to:
  
  \eq{-.2in}{
    \boxed{\sum\Delta K + \sum\Delta U = W_\text{ext} }\quad\rightarrow\quad
    \boxed{\sum U + \sum K + W_\text{ext} = \sum U' + \sum K' }
  }

  External work $W_\text{ext}$ is
  \begin{itemize}
  \item\textbf{Positive} if work is done \text{to} the system
  \item\textbf{Negative} if work is done \text{by} by the system to the
    surrounding
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



%\begin{frame}{Isolated Systems and the Conservation of Energy}
%  An \textbf{isolated system} is a system of objects that does not interact with
%  the surrounding. Think of an isolated system as a bunch of objects inside an
%  insulated box.

\begin{frame}{Example: Gravity}
  When there are no friction and drag, a free-falling object forms an isolated

    is constant

\begin{frame}{Isolated System with Changing Internal Energy}

\begin{frame}{Isolated System vs.\ Open System}

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Take the air molecule out of the \emph{system}
  \item No longer an isolated system
  \item Treat the negative work done by kinetic friction and drag as
    \emph{external work} between initial and final states

%\begin{frame}{Conservation of Energy}
%  If \emph{only} conservative forces are doing work, mechanical energy (i.e.\

%  When external non-conservative forces are also doing work, instead of

\section{Power \& Efficiency}

\begin{frame}{Power}
  \textbf{Power} is the \emph{rate} at which work is done, i.e.\ the rate at
  which energy is being transformed:

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{P(t) = \diff Wt}\quad\quad
    \boxed{\overline P = \frac W{\Delta t}}
  }
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
      \rowcolor{pink}
      \textbf{Quantity}  & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{SI Unit} \\ \hline
      Instantaneous and average power & $P$, $\overline P$ & \si\watt \\
      Work done          & $W$ & \si\joule \\
      Time interval      & $\Delta t$ & \si\second
    \end{tabular}
  \end{center}
  In engineering, power is often more critical than the actual amount of work
  done.
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Power}
  If a force is used to push an object, the instantaneous power produced by the
  force is:
  
  \eq{-.1in}{
    P(t)=\diff Wt=\frac{F\cdot\dl\vec x}{\dl t}
    =\vec F\cdot\diff{\vec x}t \quad\longrightarrow\quad
    \boxed{P(t)=\vec F(t)\cdot\vec v(t)}
  }
  
  Application: aerodynamics
  \begin{itemize}
  \item When an object moves through air, the applied force must overcome air
    resistance (drag force), which is proportional with $v^2$
    \item Therefore ``aerodynamic power'' must scale with $v^3$ (i.e.\ doubling
      your speed requires $2^3=8$ times more power)
    \item Important when aerodynamic forces dominate
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}{Efficiency}
  \textbf{Efficiency} is the ratio of useful energy or work output to the total
  energy or work input

  \eq{-.1in}{
    \boxed{ \eta = \frac{E_o}{E_i}\times\SI{100}\percent }\quad
    \boxed{ \eta = \frac{W_o}{W_i}\times\SI{100}\percent }
  }
  \begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{l|c|c}
      \rowcolor{pink}
      \textbf{Quantity} & \textbf{Symbol} & \textbf{SI Unit} \\ \hline
      Useful output energy & $E_o$  & \si\joule \\
      Input energy         & $E_i$  & \si\joule \\
      Useful output work   & $W_o$  & \si\joule \\
      Input work           & $W_i$  & \si\joule \\
      Efficiency           & $\eta$ & no units
    \end{tabular}

  Efficiency is always $0\leq\eta<\SI{100}\percent$
