  In another experiment on the same table, the target ball $B$ is replaced by
  target ball $C$ of mass 0.10 kg. The incident ball $A$ again slides at
  \SI{1.4}{\metre\per\second}, as shown above left, but this time makes a
  glancing collision with the target ball $C$ that is at rest at the edge of
  the table. The target ball $C$ strikes the floor at point $P$, which is at a
  horizontal displacement of \SI{.15}{\metre} from the point of the collision,
  and at a horizontal angle of \ang{30} from the $+x$-axis, as shown above
  right.
  \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item Calculate the speed $v$ of the target ball $C$ immediately after the
    collision.
  \item Calculate the $y$-component of incident ball $A$'s momentum immediately
    after the collision.

    \underline{Note:} Figure not drawn to scale.
  \end{center}
\item (Suggested time 25 minutes) A long track, inclined at an angle $\theta$
  to the horizontal, has small speed bumps on it. The bumps are evenly spaced a
  distance $d$ apart, as shown in the figure above. The track is actually much
  longer than shown, with over 100 bumps. A cart of mass $M$ is released from
  rest at the top of the track. A student notices that after reaching the
  40th bump the cart's average speed between successive bumps no longer
  increases, reaching a maximum value $v_\mathrm{avg}$. This means the time
  interval taken to move from one bump to the next bump becomes constant.
  \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
  \item Consider the cart's motion between bump 41 and bump 44.
    \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item In the figure below, sketch a graph of the cart's velocity $v$ as a
      function of time from the moment it reaches bump 41 until the moment it
      reaches bump 44.
    \item Over the same time interval, draw a dashed horizontal line at
      $v=v_\text{avg}$. Label this line ``$v_\text{avg}$''.
    \end{enumerate}

      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \draw[thick,->](0,0)--(4,0) node[pos=0,left]{0} node[pos=1,right]{Time};
        \draw[thick,->](0,0)--(0,3) node[pos=1,above]{$v$};
        \draw[dashed](.2,-.1)--(.2,2.8) node[pos=0,below]{41};
        \draw[dashed](1.2,-.1)--(1.2,2.8) node[pos=0,below]{42};
        \draw[dashed](2.2,-.1)--(2.2,2.8) node[pos=0,below]{43};
        \draw[dashed](3.2,-.1)--(3.2,2.8) node[pos=0,below]{44};
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
  \item Suppose the distance between the bumps is increased but everything else
    stays the same. Is the maximum speed of the cart now greater than, less
    than, or the same as it was with the bumps closer together?

    \vspace{.4in}
  \item With the bumps returned to the original spacing, the track is tilted to
    a greater ramp angle $\theta$. Is the maximum speed of the cart greater
    than, less than, or the same as it was when the ramp angle was smaller?

    \vspace{.2in}
    \underline{\hspace{.25in}} Greater than\hspace{.5in}

  \item Before deriving an equation for a quantity such as $v_\text{avg}$, it
    can be useful to come up with an equation that is intuitively expected to
    be true. That way, the derivation can be checked later to see if it makes
    sense physically. A student comes up with the following equation for the
    cart's maximum average speed:\\
    $\displaystyle v_\text{avg}=C\frac{Mg\sin\theta}{d}$, where $C$ is a
    positive constant.
    \begin{enumerate}[nosep]
    \item To test the equation, the student rolls a cart down the long track
      with speed bumps many times in front of a motion detector. The student
      varies the mass $M$ of the cart with each trial but keeps everything else
      the same. The graph shown below is the student's plot of the data for
      $v_\text{avg}$ as a function of $M$.
      \cpic{.4}{results}
      Are these data consistent with the student's equation?

      \vspace{.1in}
      \underline{\hspace{.25in}} Yes\hspace{.5in}
      \underline{\hspace{.25in}} No

      \vspace{.1in}Briefly explain your reasoning.\vspace{.4in}

    \item Another student suggests that whether or not the data above are
      consistent with the equation, the equation could be incorrect for other
      reasons. Does the equation make physical sense?

      \vspace{.1in}
      \underline{\hspace{.25in}} Yes\hspace{.5in}
      \underline{\hspace{.25in}} No
