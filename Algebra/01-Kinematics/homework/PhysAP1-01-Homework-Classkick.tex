    \part Consider the cart's motion between bump 41 and bump 44.
    \begin{subparts}
      \subpart In the figure below, sketch a graph of the cart's velocity $v$
      as a function of time from the moment it reaches bump 41 until the moment
      it reaches bump 44.
      \subpart Over the same time interval, draw a dashed horizontal line at
      $v=v_\text{avg}$. Label this line ``$v_\text{avg}$''.

    \part Suppose the distance between the bumps is increased but everything
    else stays the same. Is the maximum speed of the cart now greater than, less
    than, or the same as it was with the bumps closer together?
    Briefly explain your reasoning.

    \part With the bumps returned to the original spacing, the track is tilted
    to a greater ramp angle $\theta$. Is the maximum speed of the cart greater
    than, less than, or the same as it was when the ramp angle was smaller?
    Briefly explain your reasoning.

    \part Before deriving an equation for a quantity such as $v_\text{avg}$, it
    can be useful to come up with an equation that is intuitively expected to
    be true. That way, the derivation can be checked later to see if it makes
    sense physically. A student comes up with the following equation for the
    cart's maximum average speed: $v_\text{avg}=C\dfrac{Mg\sin\theta}{d}$, where
    $C$ is a positive constant.
    \begin{subparts}
      \subpart To test the equation, the student rolls a cart down the long
      track with speed bumps many times in front of a motion detector. The
      student varies the mass $M$ of the cart with each trial but keeps
      everything else the same. The graph shown below is the student's plot of
      the data for $v_\text{avg}$ as a function of $M$.
      \cpic{.4}{results}
      Are these data consistent with the student's equation? Briefly explain
      your reasoning.
      
      \vspace{.1in}
      \underline{\hspace{.25in}} Yes\hspace{.5in}
      \underline{\hspace{.25in}} No

      \vspace{.1in}

      \subpart Another student suggests that whether or not the data above are
      consistent with the equation, the equation could be incorrect for other
      reasons. Does the equation make physical sense? Briefly explain your
      reasoning.

  makes an angle of \ang{10} with the horizontal. The projectile hits the

  \question A high-powered rifle shoots bullets that leave the mizzle at
  \SI{1.1e3}{\metre\per\second}. If a bullet is to hit a target
  \SI{950}{\metre} away at the level, the gun must be aimed at a point above
  the target. Neglecting air resistance, how far above the target is this
  point?
