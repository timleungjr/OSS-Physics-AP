  % TAKEN FROM THE 2016 AP PHYSICS 1 EXAM FREE-RESPONSE QUESTION #2
\item (Suggested time 25 minutes) A new kind of toy ball is advertised to
  ``bounce perfectly elastically'' off hard surfaces. A student suspects,
  however, that no collision can be perfectly elastic. The student hypothesizes
  that the collisions are very close to being perfectly elastic for low-speed
  collisions but that they deviate more and more from being perfectly elastic
  as the collision speed increases.
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt,noitemsep]
  \item Design an experiment to test the student's hypothesis about collisions
    of the ball with a hard surface. The student has equipment that would
    usually be found in a school physics laboratory.
    \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt,noitemsep]
    \item What quantities would be measured?
    \item What equipment would be used for the measurements, and how would that
      equipment be used?
    \item Describe the procedure to be used to test the student's hypothesis.
      Give enough detail so that another student could replicate the experiment.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Describe how you would represent the data in a graph or table. Explain
    how that representation would be used to determine whether the data are
    consistent with the student's hypothesis.
  \item A student carries out the experiment and analysis described in parts
    (a) and (b). The student immediately concludes that something went wrong in
    the experiment because the graph or table shows behavior that is elastic
    for low-speed collisions but appears to violate a basic physics principle
    for high-speed collisions.
    \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt,noitemsep]
    \item Give an example of a graph or table that indicates nearly elastic
      behavior for low-speed collisions but appears to violate a basic physics
      principle for high-speed collisions.
    \item State one physics principle that appears to be violated in the graph
      or table given in part (c)i. Several physics principles might appear to
      be violated, but you only need to identify one.

    \item Briefly explain what aspect of the graph or table indicates that th
      e physics principle is violated, and why.

\item The Ballistic Pendulum. To determine the muzzle speed of a gun, a bullet
  is shot into a mass $M$ from a string as shown below, causing $M$ to swing
  upward through a maximum angle of $\theta$.
  \begin{center}
    \pic{.4}{ballastic.png}
  \end{center}
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item What is the speed of $M$ the instant after the bullet lodges in it?
    \vspace{1.25in}
  \item What is the speed of the bullet before it hits $M$?
    \vspace{1.25in}
  \item What is the tension in the string at the highest point of the pendulum's
    swing (when the string makes an angle of $\theta$ with the vertical as
    shown)?
  \end{enumerate}
  \newpage
  
%\item Two masses are connected by a spring (spring constant $k$) resting on a
%  frictionless horizontal surface as shown. The right mass is initially in
%  contact with a wall. A brief blow to the left block leaves it with an initial
%  velocity $v_0$ to the right.
%  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt]
%  \item What is the maximum compression of the spring as the left block moves
%    to the right?
%    \vspace{1in}
%  \end{enumerate}
%  After the spring is maximally compressed, it eventually moves to the left,
%  away from wall. As it moves away from the wall, it continues oscillating.

%  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt,resume]
%  \item What is the net momentum of the two masses after they leave the wall?
%    \vspace{1in}
%  \item What is the total mechanical energy of the oscillating spring system?
%    \vspace{1in}
%  \item What is the relative velocity of the two masses when the spring is
%    maximally compressed?
%    \vspace{1in}
%  \item What is the maximum compression of the spring after the two masses have
%    left the wall? Compare the compression to the maximum compression calculated
%    in part (a) and explain any similarities and differences.

%\item In the billiards shot shown in the figure below, the initial direction of
%  the cue ball is perpendicular to the line joining the centers of the other
%  two balls, which are touching. The cue ball strikes both balls simultaneously.
%  Use the symmetry of the situation along with the appropriate conservation
%  laws to find the final velocities of all three balls.

\item A stream of glass beads, each with a mass of 0.5 g, comes out of a
  horizontal tube at 100 per second. The beads fall a distance of 0.5 m to a
  balance pan and bounce back to their original height as shown in the figure
  below. How much mass must be placed in the other pan of the balance to keep
  the pointer at zero?
