\item (Suggested time 25 minutes) A new kind of toy ball is advertised to
  ``bounce perfectly elastically'' off hard surfaces. A student suspects,
  however, that no collision can be perfectly elastic. The student hypothesizes
  that the collisions are very close to being perfectly elastic for low-speed
  collisions but that they deviate more and more from being perfectly elastic
  as the collision speed increases.
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt,noitemsep]
  \item Design an experiment to test the student's hypothesis about collisions
    of the ball with a hard surface. The student has equipment that would
    usually be found in a school physics laboratory.
    \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt,noitemsep]
    \item What quantities would be measured?
    \item What equipment would be used for the measurements, and how would that
      equipment be used?
    \item Describe the procedure to be used to test the student's hypothesis.
      Give enough detail so that another student could replicate the experiment.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item Describe how you would represent the data in a graph or table. Explain
    how that representation would be used to determine whether the data are
    consistent with the student's hypothesis.
  \item A student carries out the experiment and analysis described in parts
    (a) and (b). The student immediately concludes that something went wrong in
    the experiment because the graph or table shows behavior that is elastic
    for low-speed collisions but appears to violate a basic physics principle
    for high-speed collisions.
    \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt,noitemsep]
    \item Give an example of a graph or table that indicates nearly elastic
      behavior for low-speed collisions but appears to violate a basic physics
      principle for high-speed collisions.
    \item State one physics principle that appears to be violated in the graph
      or table given in part (c)i. Several physics principles might appear to
      be violated, but you only need to identify one.

    \item Briefly explain what aspect of the graph or table indicates that th
      e physics principle is violated, and why.

\item The Ballistic Pendulum. To determine the muzzle speed of a gun, a bullet
  is shot into a mass $M$ from a string as shown below, causing $M$ to swing
  upward through a maximum angle of $\theta$.
  \begin{center}

  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item What is the speed of $M$ the instant after the bullet lodges in it?
    \vspace{1.25in}
  \item What is the speed of the bullet before it hits $M$?
    \vspace{1.25in}
  \item What is the tension in the string at the highest point of the pendulum's
    swing (when the string makes an angle of $\theta$ with the vertical as
    shown)?

\item An 800.0-kg car is traveling along a wet road at a velocity of
  \SI{25.5}{\metre\per\second}. A \num{1000.}-kg car is traveling along the
  same road in the same direction at \SI{34.7}{\metre\per\second}. The two cars
  collide and lock together. Answer the following questions.
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt]
  \item The two interlocked cars proceed at what velocity after the collision?
  \item Compare the kinetic energy of the two-car system immediately before
    the collision and after the collision.
  \item Discuss any transfer of energy that occurs, and explain whether this is
    an elastic or inelastic collision.
  \item If the coefficient of sliding friction between the tires of the cars
    and the wet pavement is 0.7, calculate the force of friction.
  \item  How long does it take for the two interlocked cars to come to a
    complete stop on the wet pavement?

\item A stream of glass beads, each with a mass of 0.5 g, comes out of a
  horizontal tube at 100 per second. The beads fall a distance of 0.5 m to a
  balance pan and bounce back to their original height as shown in the figure
  below. How much mass must be placed in the other pan of the balance to keep
  the pointer at zero?
