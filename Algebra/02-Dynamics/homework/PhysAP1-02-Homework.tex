  that is ignited at time $t=0$, as shown above. The engine provides an impulse
  of \SI{20.}{\newton\second} by firing for \SI{2.}{\second}. Upon reaching its
  maximum height, the rocket deploys a parachute, and then descends vertically
  to the ground.
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt,topsep=0pt,noitemsep]
  \item On the figures below, draw and label a free-body diagram for the rocket
    during each of the following intervals.

\item An ideal spring of unstretched length 0.20 m is placed horizontally on a
  frictionless table as shown above. One end of the spring is fixed and the
  other end is attached to a block of mass $M=\SI{8.}{\kilo\gram}$. The 8.0 kg
  block is also attached to a massless string that passes over a frictionless
  pulley. A block of mass $m=\SI{4.}{\kilo\gram}$ hands from the other end of
  the string. When this spring-and-block system is in equilibrium, the length
  of the spring is 0.25 m and the 4.0 kg block is 0.70 m above the floor.
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt,topsep=0pt,noitemsep]
  \item On the figures below, draw free-body diagrams showing and labelling
    the forces on each block when the system is in equilibrium.

\item A 2.0 kg block sits on a 4.0 kg block that is resting on a frictionless
  table, as shown below. The coefficient of friction between the blocks are
  $\mu_s=0.30$ and $\mu_k=0.20$.
  \begin{enumerate}[topsep=0pt,itemsep=0pt]
  \item What is the maximum force $\mb{F}$ that can be applied if the
    2.0 kg block is not to slide on the 4.0 kg block.
  \item If $\mb{F}$ is half this value, find the acceleration of each block and
    the force of friction acting on each block.
  \item If $\mb{F}$ is twice the value found in (a), find the acceleration of
    each block.
