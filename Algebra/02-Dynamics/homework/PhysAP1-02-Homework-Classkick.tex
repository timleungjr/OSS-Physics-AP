  \question An ideal spring of unstretched length 0.20 m is placed horizontally
  on a frictionless table as shown above. One end of the spring is fixed and the
  other end is attached to a block of mass $M=\SI{8.}{\kilo\gram}$. The 8.0 kg
  block is also attached to a massless string that passes over a frictionless
  pulley. A block of mass $m=\SI{4.}{\kilo\gram}$ hangs from the other end of
  the string. When this spring-and-block system is in equilibrium, the length
  of the spring is 0.25 m and the 4.0 kg block is 0.70 m above the floor.
  \begin{parts}
    \part On the figures below, draw free-body diagrams showing and labelling
    the forces on each block when the system is in equilibrium.

  \question A pick-up truck with two stacked crates in the truck bed brakes
  quickly. The crate on the bottom just barely stays put on the bed of the
  truck. Does the top crate stay put or does it fall off? The top crate has a
  mass of \SI{27}{\kilo\gram} and the mass of the bottom crate is
  \SI{22}{\kilo\gram}. The coefficient of static friction between the bottom
  crate and the truck is 0.42, and the coefficient of kinetic friction for that
  surface is 0.35. The coefficient of static friction between the crate is
  0.40, and the coefficient of kinetic friction is 0.32.
