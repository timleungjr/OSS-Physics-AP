  \item A wheel of radius $R$ and negligible mass is mounted on a horizontal
    frictionless axle so that the wheel is in a vertical plane. Three small
    objects having masses $m$, $M$ and $2M$, respectively, are mounted on the
    rim of the wheel, as shown above. If the system is in static equilibrium,
    what is the value of $m$ in terms of $M$?

  \item A 2 kg object moves in a circle of radius 4 m at a constant speed of
    \SI{3}{\metre\per\second}. A net force of 4.5 N acts on the object. What is
    the angular momentum of the object with respect to an axis perpendicular
    the circle and through its center?

  \textbf{Questions \ref{mass1}--\ref{mass2}} A \SI{.4}{\kilo\gram} mass is
  oscillating on a spring that has a force constant of
  $k=\SI{1000}{\newton\per\metre}$.

  \item Which of the following measurements would allow you to determine the
    maximum velocity experienced by the mass?

    \item No additional information is required.
    \item Minimum velocity
    \item Maximum acceleration
    \item None of these would allow you to determine maximum velocity

  \item Which of the following statements concerning the oscillatory motion
    described is correct? (All statements refer to magnitudes.)
    \label{mass2}
    \begin{enumerate}[nosep,leftmargin=18pt,label=(\Alph*)]
    \item The maximum velocity and maximum acceleration occurs at the same time.
    \item The maximum velocity occurs when the acceleration is a minimum.
    \item The velocity is always directly proportional to the displacement.
    \item The maximum velocity occurs when the displacement is a maximum.

  \item Cylindrical disk $A$ is rotating freely about an axis when an
    identical disk $B$ that is not rotating is dropped directly on top of disk
    $A$. If the two disks stick together, how does the total angular momentum
    and total kinetic energy of the two-disk system after the disks are stuck
    together compare to that of the system before disk $B$ was dropped?
