  is required to convert the ice cube to water at temperature $T_2$ where,
  $\SI{273}{\kelvin}<T_2<\SI{373}{\kelvin}$?
  \begin{choices}
    \choice $m[c_i(273-T_1)+L+c_w(373-T_2)]$
    \choice $m[c_i(273-T_1)+L+c_w(T_2-273)]$
    \choice $c_i(273-T_1)+c_w(T_2-273)$
    \choice $mL+c_w(T_2-T_1)$
    \choice $mL+\left(\dfrac{c_w-c_i}{2}\right)(T_2-T_1)$
  \end{choices}
