  \question A wooden wheel of mass $M$, consisting of a rim with spokes, rolls
  down a ramp that makes an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal, as shown above.
  The ramp exerts a force of static friction on the wheel so that the wheel
  rolls without slipping.
  \begin{parts}
  \part
    \begin{subparts}
      \subpart On the diagram below, draw and label the forces (not components)
      that act on the wheel as it rolls down the ramp, which is indicated by the
      dashed line. To clearly indicate at which point on the wheel each force
      is exerted, draw each force as a distinct arrow starting on, and pointing
      away from, the point at which the force is exerted. The lengths of the
      arrows need not indicate the relative magnitudes of the forces.
      \cpic{.22}{wooden-wheel2}
      
      \subpart As the wheel rolls down the ramp, which force causes a change in
      the angular velocity of the wheel with respect to its center of mass?
      Briefly explain your reasoning.
    \end{subparts}

    \part For this ramp angle, the force of friction exerted on the wheel is
    less than the maximum possible static friction force. Instead, the
    magnitude of the force of static friction exerted on the wheel is 40
    percent of the magnitude of the force or force component directed opposite
    to the force of friction. Derive an expression for the linear acceleration
    of the wheel's center of mass in terms of $M$, $\theta$, and physical
    constants, as appropriate.
    
    \part In a second experiment on the same ramp, a block of ice, also with
    mass $M$, is released from rest at the same instant the wheel is released
    from rest, and from the same height. The block slides down the ramp with
    negligible friction.
    \begin{subparts}
      \subpart Which object, if either, reaches the bottom of the ramp with the
      greatest speed?Briefly explain your answer, reasoning in terms of forces.

      the disk's angular velocity as a function of time from $t=0$ to $t=t_1$,
      which is the time at which the disk came to rest in part (a).

      acceleration as a function of time from $t=0$ to $t=t_1$.

    \part The student is trying to mathematically model the magnitude $\tau$ of
     the torque exerted by the axle on the disk when the oil is present at
     times $t>\dfrac12t_1$. The student writes down the following two
     equations, each of which includes a positive constant ($C_1$ or $C_2$)
     with appropriate units.
     \begin{enumerate}
       \item $\tau=C_1\left(t-\dfrac12t_1\right)$ (for $t>\dfrac12 t_1$)
       \item $\tau=\dfrac{C_2}{\left(t+\dfrac12t_1\right)}$ (for
         $t>\dfrac12t_1$)
     \end{enumerate}
     Which equation better mathematically models this experiment? Briefly
     explain why the equation you selected is plausible and why the other
     equation is not plausible.
