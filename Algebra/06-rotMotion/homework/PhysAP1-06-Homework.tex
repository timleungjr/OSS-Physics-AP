\begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=15pt]
\item A wooden wheel of mass $M$, consisting of a rim with spokes, rolls down
  a ramp that makes an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal, as shown above. The
  ramp exerts a force of static friction on the wheel so that the wheel rolls
  without slipping.
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=15pt,noitemsep]
  \item
    \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=15pt,noitemsep]
    \item On the diagram below, draw and label the forces (not components) that
      act on the wheel as it rolls down the ramp, which is indicated by the
      dashed line. To clearly indicate at which point on the wheel each force
      is exerted, draw each force as a distinct arrow starting on, and pointing
      away from, the point at which the force is exerted. The lengths of the
      arrows need not indicate the relative magnitudes of the forces.
      \begin{center}
        \pic{.22}{wooden-wheel2}

    \item As the wheel rolls down the ramp, which force causes a change in the
      angular velocity of the wheel with respect to its center of mass? Briefly
      explain your reasoning.
      \vspace{.7in}
    \end{enumerate}

  \item For this ramp angle, the force of friction exerted on the wheel is less
    than the maximum possible static friction force. Instead, the magnitude of
    the force of static friction exerted on the wheel is 40 percent of the
    magnitude of the force or force component directed opposite to the force of
    friction. Derive an expression for the linear acceleration of the wheel's
    center of mass in terms of $M$, $\theta$, and physical constants, as
    appropriate.
    \newpage
    
  \item In a second experiment on the same ramp, a block of ice, also with mass
    $M$, is released from rest at the same instant the wheel is released from
    rest, and from the same height. The block slides down the ramp with
    negligible friction.

      greatest speed?

      speed.

   \item The student is trying to mathematically model the magnitude $\tau$ of
     the torque exerted by the axle on the disk when the oil is present at
     times $\displaystyle t>\frac12t_1$. The student writes down the following
     two equations, each of which includes a positive constant ($C_1$ or $C_2$)
     with appropriate units.
     \begin{enumerate}[label={(\arabic*)},leftmargin=15pt]
     \item$\displaystyle\tau=C_1\left(t-\frac12t_1\right)$ (for $t>\frac12 t_1$)
     \item$\displaystyle\tau=\frac{C_2}{\left(t+\frac12t_1\right)}$ (for
       $t>\frac12t_1$)
     \end{enumerate}
     Which equation better mathematically models this experiment?

     \vspace{.1in}
     \underline{\hspace{.3in}}Equation (1)\hspace{.2in}
     \underline{\hspace{.3in}}Equation (2)
     
     \vspace{.1in}Briefly explain why the equation you selected is plausible
     and why the other equation is not plausible.
