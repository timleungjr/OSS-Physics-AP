\item You are given the apparatus represented in the figure above. A glass tube
  is fitted with a movable piston that allows the indicated length $L$ to be
  adjusted. A sine-wave generator with an adjustable frequency is connected to
  a speaker near the open end of the tube. The output of a microphone at the
  open end is connected to a waveform display. You are to use this apparatus to
  measure the speed of sound in air.
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt]
  \item Describe a procedure using the apparatus that would allow you to
    determine the speed of sound in air. Clearly indicate what quantities you
    would measure and with what instrument each measurement would be made.
    Represent each measured quantity with a different symbol.
  \item Using the symbols defined in part (a), indicate how your measurements
    can be used to determine an experimental value of the speed of sound.
  \item A more accurate experimental value can be obtained by varying one of
    the measured quantities to obtain multiple sets of data. Indicate one
    quantity that can be varied, and describe how a graph of the resulting data
    could be used to determine the speed of sound. Clearly identify independent
    and dependent variables, and indicate how the slope of the graph relates to
    the speed of sound.
