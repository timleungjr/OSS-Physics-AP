\cpic{.8}{set-up}
\begin{enumerate}
\item You are given the apparatus represented in the figure above. A glass tube
  is fitted with a movable piston that allows the indicated length $L$ to be
  adjusted. A sine-wave generator with an adjustable frequency is connected to
  a speaker near the open end of the tube. The output of a microphone at the
  open end is connected to a waveform display. You are to use this apparatus to
  measure the speed of sound in air.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Describe a procedure using the apparatus that would allow you to
    determine the speed of sound in air. Clearly indicate what quantities you
    would measure and with what instrument each measurement would be made.
    Represent each measured quantity with a different symbol.
  \item Using the symbols defined in part (a), indicate how your measurements
    can be used to determine an experimental value of the speed of sound.
  \item A more accurate experimental value can be obtained by varying one of
    the measured quantities to obtain multiple sets of data. Indicate one
    quantity that can be varied, and describe how a graph of the resulting data
    could be used to determine the speed of sound. Clearly identify independent
    and dependent variables, and indicate how the slope of the graph relates to
    the speed of sound.

\item (Suggested time 13 minutes) The figure above on the left shows a
  uniformly thick rope hanging vertically from an oscillator that is turned
  off. When the oscillator is on and set at a certain frequency, the rope forms
  the standing wave shown above on the right. $P$ and $Q$ are two points on the
  rope.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item The tension at point $P$ is greater than the tension at point $Q$.
    Briefly explain why.
  \item A student hypothesizes that increasing the tension in a rope increases
    the speed at which waves travel along the rope. In a clear, coherent
    paragraph-length response that may also contain figures and/or equations,
    explain why the standing wave shown above supports the student’s hypothesis.

    dots are labeled $P$ and $Q$.

      displacement from equilibrium. At each of $P$ and $Q$, draw an
      arrow indicating the direction of the instantaneous velocity of that dot.

      part (a)i. At each of $P$ and $Q$, draw an arrow indicating the
      direction of the instantaneous acceleration of that dot. If either dot
      has zero acceleration, write ``$a=0$'' next to the dot.

  \cpic{.65}{string-mass}
\item (7 points, suggested time 13 minutes) The figure above shows a string
  with one end attached to an oscillator and the other end attached to a block.
  The string passes over a massless pulley that turns with negligible friction.
  Four such strings, $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$, are set up side by side, as shown
  in the diagram below. Each oscillator is adjusted to vibrate the string at
  its fundamental frequency $f$. The distance between each oscillator and
  pulley $L$ is the same, and the mass $M$ of each block is the same. However,
  the fundamental frequency of each string is different.
  \cpic{.65}{topview}

  The equation for the velocity $v$ of a wave on a string is
  $\displaystyle v=\sqrt{\frac{F_T}{m/L}}$, where $F_T$ is the tension of the
  string and $m/L$ is the mass per unit length (linear mass density) of the
  string.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item What is different about the four strings shown above that would result
    in their having different fundamental frequencies? Explain how you arrived
    at your answer.
  \item  A student graphs frequency as a function of the inverse of the linear
    mass density. Will the graph be linear? Explain how you arrived at your
    answer.
  \item The frequency of the oscillator connected to string $D$ is changed so
    that the string vibrates in its second harmonic. On the side view of string
    $D$ below, mark and label the points on the string that have the greatest
    average vertical speed.
