\begin{enumerate}
\item %(7 points, suggested time 13 minutes)
  Block $P$ of mass $m$ is on a horizontal, frictionless surface and is
  attached to a spring with spring constant $k$. The block is oscillating with
  period $T_P$ and amplitude $A_P$ about the spring's equilibrium position
  $x_0$. A second block $Q$ of mass $2m$ is then dropped from rest and lands on
  block $P$ at the instant it passes through the equilibrium position, as shown
  above. Block $Q$ immediately sticks to the top of block $P$, and the
  two-block system oscillates with period $T_{PQ}$ and amplitude $A_{PQ}$.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine the numerical value of the ratio $T_{PQ}/T_P$.
  \item How does the amplitude of oscillation $A_{PQ}$ of the two-block system
    compare with the original amplitude $A_P$ of block $P$ alone?
