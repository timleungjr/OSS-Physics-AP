\item A projectile is fired from the edge of a cliff \SI{100}{\metre} high with
  an initial speed of \SI{60}{\metre\per\second} at an angle of elevation of
  \ang{45}.
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item Write equation for $x(t)$, $y(t)$, $v_x$ and $v_y$. Choose the origin of
    your coordinate system at the particle's original location.
    \vspace{1.25in}
  \item Calculate the location and velocity of the particle at time
    $t=\SI{5}{s}$.
    \vspace{1.25in}
  \end{enumerate}
  Suppose the projectile experiences an internal explosion at time $t=\SI{4}{s}$
  with an internal force purely in the $y$-direction, causing it to break into
  a \SI{2}{\kg} and a \SI{1}{\kg} fragment.
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,resume]
  \item If the \SI{2}{\kg} fragment is \SI{77}{m} above the height of the
    cliff at $t=\SI{5}{s}$, what is the $y$-coordinate of the position of the
    \SI{1}{\kg} piece?
    \vspace{1.25in}
  \item If the speed of the \SI{2}{kg} fragment is \SI{46}{m/s} and the
    fragment is falling at $t=\SI{5}{s}$, what is the $y$-component of the
    velocity of the \SI{1}{kg} fragment?

\item The Ballistic Pendulum. To determine the muzzle speed of a gun, a bullet
  is shot into a mass $M$ from a string as shown below, causing $M$ to swing
  upward through a maximum angle of $\theta$.

    swing (when the string makes an angle of $\theta$ with the vertical as
    shown)?

  \newpage
\item Two masses are connected by a spring (spring constant $k$) resting on a
  frictionless horizontal surface as shown. The right mass is initially in
  contact with a wall. A brief blow to the left block leaves it with an initial
  velocity $v_0$ to the right.
  \begin{enumerate}[leftmargin=18pt]
  \item What is the maximum compression of the spring as the left block moves
    to the right?
    \vspace{1in}

  After the spring is maximally compressed, it eventually moves to the left,
  away from wall. As it moves away from the wall, it continues oscillating.
