  \question A block of mass $m$ is projected up from the bottom of an inclined
  ramp with an initial velocity of magnitude $v_0$. The ramp has negligible
  friction and makes an angle $\theta$ with the horizontal. A motion sensor
  aimed down the ramp is mounted at the top of the incline so that the positive
  direction is down the ramp. The block starts a distance $D$ from the motion
  sensor, as shown above. The block slides partway up the ramp, stops before
  reaching the sensor, and then slides back down.
  \begin{parts}
    \part Consider the motion of the block at some time $t$ after it has been
    projected up the ramp. Express your answers in terms of $m$, $D$, $v_0$,
    $t$, $\theta$ and physical constants, as appropriate.
    \begin{subparts}
      \subpart Determine the acceleration $a$ of the block.
      \subpart Determine an expression for the velocity $v$ of the block.
      \subpart Determine an expression for the position $x$ of the block.

    \part Derive an expression for the position $x_\text{min}$ of the block when
    it is closest to the motion sensor. Express your answer in terms of $m$,
    $D$, $v_0$, $\theta$, and physical constants, as appropriate.
    
    \part On the axes provided below, sketch graphs of position $x$, velocity
    $v$, and acceleration $a$ as functions of time $t$ for the motion of the
    block while it goes up and back down the ramp. Explicitly label any
    intercepts, asymptotes, maxima, or minima with numerical values or
    algebraic expressions, as appropriate.

    \part After the block slides back down and leaves the bottom of the ramp, it
    slides on a horizontal surface with a coefficient of friction given by
    $\mu_k$. Derive an expression for the distance the block slides before
    stopping. Express your answer in terms of $m$, $D$, $v_0$, $\theta$,
    $\mu_k$, and physical constants, as appropriate.

  \item Suppose the ramp now has friction. The same block is projected up with
    the same initial speed $v_0$ and comes back down the ramp. On the axes
    provided below, sketch a graph of the velocity $v$ as a function of time $t$
    for the motion of the block while it goes up and back down the ramp,
    arriving at the bottom of the ramp at time $t_f$. Explicitly label any
    intercepts, asymptotes, maxima, or minima with numerical values or
    algebraic expressions, as appropriate.

  \question A skier of mass $m$ will be pulled up a hill by a rope, as shown
  above. The magnitude of the acceleration of the skier as a function of time
  $t$ can be modeled by the equations
  \begin{align*}
    a &=a_\text{max}\sin\left(\frac{\pi t}{T}\right)  &(0<t<T)&\\
    &=0 & (t\geq T)&
  \end{align*}
  where $a_\text{max}$ and $T$ are constants. The hill is inclined at an angle
  $\theta$ above the horizontal, and friction between the skis and the snow is
  negligible. Express your answers in terms of given quantities and fundamental
  constants.
  \begin{parts}
    \part  Derive an expression for the velocity of the skier as a function of
    time during the acceleration. Assume the skier starts from rest.
    
    \part Derive an expression for the work done by the net force on the skier
    from rest until terminal speed is reached.
    
    \part Determine the magnitude of the force exerted by the rope on the skier
    at terminal speed.
    
    \part Derive an expression for the total impulse imparted to the skier
    during the acceleration.
    
    \part Suppose that the magnitude of the acceleration is instead modeled as
    $a=a_\text{max}e^{-\pi t/2T}$ for all $t>0$, where $a_\text{max}$ and $T$
    are the same as in the original model. On the axes below, sketch the graphs
    of the force exerted by the rope on the skier for the two models, from
    $t=0$ to a time $t>T$. Label the original model $F_1$ and the new model
    $F_2$.
