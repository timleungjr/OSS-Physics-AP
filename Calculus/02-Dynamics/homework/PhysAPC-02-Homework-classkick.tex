  \question A box of mass $m$ initially at rest is acted upon by a constant
  applied force of magnitude $F_A$, as shown in the figure above. The friction
  between the box and the horizontal surface can be assumed to be negligible,
  but the box is subject to a drag force of magnitude $k\varv$ where $\varv$ is
  the speed of the box and $k$ is a positive constant. Express all your answers
  in terms of the given quantities and fundamental constants, as appropriate.

  \question An amusement park ride features a passenger compartment of mass $M$
  that is released from rest at point $A$, as shown in the figure above, and
  moves along a track to point $E$. The compartment is in free fall between
  points $A$ and $B$, which are a distance of $3R/4$ apart, then moves along
  the circular arc of radius $R$ between points $B$ and $D$. Assume the track is
  frictionless from point $A$ to point $D$ and the dimensions of the passenger
  compartment are negligible compared to $R$.
  \begin{parts}
    \part On the dot below that represents the passenger compartment, draw and
    label the forces (not components) that act on the passenger compartment
    when it is at point $C$, which is at an angle $\theta$ from point $B$.

    besides what you have shown in part (a) to assist in your solution, use the
    space below. Do NOT add anything to the figure in part (a).

    \part Derive an expression for the speed $\varv_D$ of the passenger
    compartment as it reaches point $D$ in terms of $M$, $R$, and fundamental
    constants, as appropriate.

    numerical value of the coefficient of friction $\mu$ between the
    compartment and the track.

      Now consider the case in which there is no friction between the
      compartment and the track, but instead the compartment is brought to rest
      by a braking force $-k\mb{v}$, where $k$ is a constant and $\mb{v}$ is the
      velocity of the compartment. Express all algebraic answers to the
      following in terms of $M$, $R$, $k$, $\varv_D$, and fundamental

  \question A block of mass $M/2$ rests on a frictionless horizontal table, as
  shown above. It is connected to one end of a string that passes over a
  massless pulley and has another block of mass $M/2$ hanging from its other
  end. The apparatus is released from rest.
  \begin{parts}
    \part Derive an expression for the speed $\varv_h$ of the hanging block as
    a function of the distance $d$ it descends.

    \uplevel{
      Now the block and pulley system is replaced by a uniform rope of length
      $L$ and mass $M$, with one end of the rope hanging slightly over the edge
      of the frictionless table. The rope is released from rest, and at some
      time later there is a length $y$ of rope hanging over the edge, as shown
      below. Express your answers to parts (b), (c), and (d) in terms of
      $y$, $L$, $M$, and fundamental constants.

    \part Determine an expression for the force of gravity on the hanging part
    of the rope as a function of $y$.
    
    \part Derive an expression for the work done by gravity on the rope as a
    function of $y$, assuming $y$ is initially zero.

    \part Derive an expression for the speed $\varv_r$ of the rope as a
    function of $y$.
    
    \part The hanging block and the right end of the rope are each allowed to
    fall a distance $L$ (the length of the rope). The string is long enough
    that the sliding block does not hit the pulley. Indicate whether $\varv_h$
    from part (a) or $\varv_r$ from part (d) is greater after the block and the
    end of the rope have traveled this distance. Justify your answer.

    \underline{\hspace{.5in}} $\varv_h$ is greater.\hspace{1in}
    \underline{\hspace{.5in}} $\varv_r$ is greater.\hspace{1in}
