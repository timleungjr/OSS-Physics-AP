  \question A box of mass $m$ initially at rest is acted upon by a constant
  applied force of magnitude $F_A$, as shown in the figure above. The friction
  between the box and the horizontal surface can be assumed to be negligible,
  but the box is subject to a drag force of magnitude $k\varv$ where $\varv$ is
  the speed of the box and $k$ is a positive constant. Express all your answers
  in terms of the given quantities and fundamental constants, as appropriate.
  \begin{parts}
    \part The dot below represents the box. Draw and label the forces (not
    components) that act on the box.

    \end{center}
    \vspace{.5in}

    \part Write, but do not solve, a differential equation that could be used to
    determine the speed $\varv$ of the box as a function of time $t$. If you
    need to draw anything other than what you have shown in part (a) to assist
    in your solution, use the space below. Do NOT add anything to the figure in
    part (a).
    
    \part Determine the magnitude of the terminal velocity of the box.
    
    \part Use the differential equation from part (b) to derive the equation for
    the speed $\varv$ of the box as a function of time $t$. Assume that
    $\varv=0$ at time $t=0$.
    
    \part On the axes below, sketch a graph of the speed $\varv$ of the box as a
    function of time $t$. Explicitly label any intercepts, asymptotes, maxima,
    or minima with numerical values or algebraic expressions, as appropriate.

  \question An amusement park ride features a passenger compartment of mass $M$
  that is released from rest at point $A$, as shown in the figure above, and
  moves along a track to point $E$. The compartment is in free fall between
  points $A$ and $B$, which are a distance of $3R/4$ apart, then moves along
  the circular arc of radius $R$ between points $B$ and $D$. Assume the track is
  frictionless from point $A$ to point $D$ and the dimensions of the passenger
  compartment are negligible compared to $R$.
  \begin{parts}
    \part On the dot below that represents the passenger compartment, draw and
    label the forces (not components) that act on the passenger compartment
    when it is at point $C$, which is at an angle $\theta$ from point $B$.
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tikzpicture}
        \fill(0,0) circle(.25);
        \draw[rotate=35,dashed,very thick](0,2)--(0,-2);
      \end{tikzpicture}
    \end{center}
    
    \part In terms of $\theta$ and the magnitudes of the forces drawn in part
    (a), determine an expression for the magnitude of the centripetal force
    acting on the compartment at point $C$. If you need to draw anything
    besides what you have shown in part (a) to assist in your solution, use the
    space below. Do NOT add anything to the figure in part (a).

    \part Derive an expression for the speed $\varv_D$ of the passenger
    compartment as it reaches point $D$ in terms of $M$, $R$, and fundamental
    constants, as appropriate.
  
    \uplevel{
      A force acts on the compartment between points $D$ and $E$ and brings it
      to rest at point $E$.
    }
    
    \part If the compartment is brought to rest by friction, calculate the
    numerical value of the coefficient of friction $\mu$ between the
    compartment and the track.
    
    \uplevel{
      Now consider the case in which there is no friction between the
      compartment and the track, but instead the compartment is brought to rest
      by a braking force $-k\mb{v}$, where $k$ is a constant and $\mb{v}$ is the
      velocity of the compartment. Express all algebraic answers to the
      following in terms of $M$, $R$, $k$, $v_D$, and fundamental constants, as
      appropriate.
    }

    \part Write, but do NOT solve, the differential equation for $\varv(t)$.
    \label{diffeq}
    
    \part Solve the differential equation you wrote in part (\ref{diffeq}).
    
    \part On the axes below, sketch a graph of the magnitude of the
    acceleration of the compartment as a function of time. On the axes,
    explicitly label any intercepts, asymptotes, maxima, or minima with
    numerical values or algebraic expressions, as appropriate.
