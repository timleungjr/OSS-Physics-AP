%  direction is down the ramp. The block starts a distance $D$ from the motion
%  sensor, as shown above. The block slides partway up the ramp, stops before
%  reaching the sensor, and then slides back down.
%  \begin{parts}
%    \part Consider the motion of the block at some time $t$ after it has been
%    projected up the ramp. Express your answers in terms of $m$, $D$, $v_0$,

%    it is closest to the motion sensor. Express your answer in terms of $m$,
%    $D$, $v_0$, $\theta$, and physical constants, as appropriate.

%    $v$, and acceleration $a$ as functions of time $t$ for the motion of the
%    block while it goes up and back down the ramp. Explicitly label any
%    intercepts, asymptotes, maxima, or minima with numerical values or
