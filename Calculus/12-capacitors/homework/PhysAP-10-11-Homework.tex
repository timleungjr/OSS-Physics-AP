    V(x,y,z)=\frac{kQ}{\sqrt{(x-a)^2+y^2+z^2}}
  \end{displaymath}
  \begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
  \item Find the components $E_x$, $E_y$ and $E_z$ of the electric field by
    differentiating this potential function.
  \item What simple charge distribution might be responsible for this potential?
