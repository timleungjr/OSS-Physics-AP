\item A projectile is fired horizontally from a launching device, exiting with
  a speed $v_x$. While the projectile is in the launching device, the impulse
  imparted to it is $J_p$, and the average force on it is $F_\text{avg}$. Assume
  the force becomes zero just as the projectile reaches the end of the launching
  device. Express your answers to parts (a) and (b) in terms of $v_x$, $J_p$,
  $F_\text{avg}$, and fundamental constants, as appropriate.
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item Determine an expression for the time required for the projectile to
    travel the length of the launching device.
  \item Determine an expression for the mass of the projectile.
  \end{enumerate}
  The projectile is fired horizontally into a block of wood that is clamped to
  a tabletop so that it cannot move. The projectile travels a distance $d$ into
  the block before it stops. Express all algebraic answers to the following in
  terms of $d$ and the given quantities previously indicated, as appropriate.
  \begin{enumerate}[resume]
  \item Derive an expression for the work done in stopping the projectile.
  \item Derive an expression for the average force $F_b$ exerted on the
    projectile as it comes to rest in the block.
  \end{enumerate}
  Now a new projectile and block are used, identical to the first ones, but the
  block is not clamped to the table. The projectile is again fired into the
  block of wood and travels a new distance $d_n$ into the block while the block
  slides across the table a short distance $D$. Assume the following: the
  projectile enters the block with speed $v_x$, the average force $F_b$ between
  the projectile and the block has the same value as determined in part (d),
  the average force of friction between the table and the block is $f_T$, and
  the collision is instantaneous so the frictional force is negligible
  during the collision.
  \begin{enumerate}[resume]
  \item Derive an expression for $d_n$ in terms of $d$, $D$, $f_T$, and $F_b$,
    as appropriate.
  \item Derive an expression for $d_n$ in terms of $d$, the mass $m$ of the
    projectile, and the mass $M$ of the block.
