  \question A small dart of mass \SI{.020}{\kilo\gram} is launched at an angle
  of \ang{30} above the horizontal with an initial speed of
  \SI{10}{\meter\per\second}. At the moment it reaches the highest point in its
  path and is moving horizontally, it collides with and sticks to a wooden
  block of mass \SI{.10}{\kilo\gram} that is suspended at the end of a massless
  string. The center of mass of the block is \SI{1.2}{\metre} below the pivot
  point of the string. The block and dart then swing up until the string makes
  an angle $\theta$ with the vertical, as shown above. Air resistance is
  negligible.
  \begin{parts}

  \question A projectile is fired horizontally from a launching device, exiting
  with a speed $v_x$. While the projectile is in the launching device, the

  $F_\text{avg}$. Assume the force becomes zero just as the projectile reaches
  the end of the launching device. Express your answers to parts (a) and (b) in

  appropriate.
  \begin{parts}
    \part Determine an expression for the time required for the projectile to
    travel the length of the launching device.
