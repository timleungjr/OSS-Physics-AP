  % TAKEN FROM THE 2014 AP PHYSICS EXAM QUESTION E&M.2
  \question The rectangular loop of wire shown on the left in the figure above
  has mass $M$, length $L$, width $L/4$, and resistance $R$. It is initially
  moving to the right at constant speed $\varv_0$ , with no net force acting on
  it. At time $t=0$ the loop enters a region of length $2L$ that contains a
  uniform magnetic field of magnitude $B$ directed into the page. The loop
  emerges from the field at time $t_f$ with final speed $\varv_f$. Express all
  algebraic answers to the following in terms of $M$, $L$, $R$, $B$, $\varv_0$,
  and fundamental constants, as appropriate.
  \begin{parts}
    \part Let $x$ represent the position of the right end of the loop. Place a
    check mark in the appropriate box in each column in the table below to
    indicate whether the speed of the loop increases, decreases, or stays the
    same as the loop moves to the right.
    \begin{center}
      \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|}
        \hline
        Speed of Loop & $L<x<2L$ & $2L<x<3L$ & $3L<x<4L$ & $4L<x<5L$ \\
        \hline\hline
        Increases & & & & \\
        \hline
        Dereases & & & & \\

        Stays the Same & & & & \\

    \part Derive an expression for the magnitude of the current induced in the
    loop as its right edge enters the field.

    (\ref{partb})? Justify your answer.

    its left edge leaves the field? Justify your answer.

  \question A conducting bar of mass $M$, length $L$, and negligible resistance
  is connected to two long vertical conducting rails of negligible resistance.
  The two rails are connected by a resistor of resistance $R$ at the top. The
  entire apparatus is located in a magnetic field of magnitude $B$ directed
  into the page, as shown in the figure above. The bar is released from rest
  and slides without friction down the rails.
  \begin{parts}
    \part What is the direction of the current in the resistor?
