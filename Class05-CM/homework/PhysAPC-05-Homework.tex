  \question A small dart of mass \SI{.020}{\kilo\gram} is launched at an angle
  of \ang{30} above the horizontal with an initial speed of
  \SI{10}{\meter\per\second}. At the moment it reaches the highest point in its
  path and is moving horizontally, it collides with and sticks to a wooden
  block of mass \SI{.10}{\kilo\gram} that is suspended at the end of a massless
  string. The center of mass of the block is \SI{1.2}{\metre} below the pivot
  point of the string. The block and dart then swing up until the string makes
  an angle $\theta$ with the vertical, as shown above. Air resistance is
  negligible.
  \begin{parts}
    \part Determine the speed of the dart just before it strikes the block.
    \vspace{\stretch1}
    
    \part Calculate the horizontal distance $d$ between the launching point of
    the dart and a point on the floor directly below the block.
    \vspace{\stretch1}
    
    \part Calculate the speed of the block just after the dart strikes.
    \vspace{\stretch1}
    
    \part Calculate the angle $\theta$ through which the dart and block on the
    string will rise before coming momentarily to rest.
    \vspace{\stretch1}
    
    %\part The block then continues to swing as a simple pendulum. Calculate
    %the time between when the dart collides with the block and when the block
    %first returns to its original position.

    \part In a second experiment, a dart with more mass is launched at the same
    speed and angle. The dart collides with and sticks to the same wooden block.
    Would the angle $\theta$ that the dart and block swing to increase,
    decrease, or stay the same?

  \question A crash test car of mass \SI{1000}{\kilo\gram} moving at constant
  speed of \SI{12}{\metre\per\second} collides completely inelastically with an
  object of mass $M$ at time $t=0$. The object was initially at rest. The speed
  $\varv$ in m/s of the car-object system after the collision is given as a
  function of time $t$ in seconds by the expression
  \begin{displaymath}
    \varv=\frac8{1 + 5t}

  \question A projectile is fired horizontally from a launching device, exiting
  with a speed $\varv_x$. While the projectile is in the launching device, the
  impulse imparted to it is $J$, and the average force on it is $F_\text{avg}$.
  Assume the force becomes zero just as the projectile reaches the end of the
  launching device. Express your answers to parts (a) and (b) in
  terms of $\varv_x$, $J$, $F_\text{avg}$, and fundamental constants, as
  appropriate.
  \begin{parts}
    \part Determine an expression for the time required for the projectile to
    travel the length of the launching device.
    
    \part Determine an expression for the mass of the projectile.
    
    \uplevel{The projectile is fired horizontally into a block of wood that is
      clamped to a tabletop so that it cannot move. The projectile travels a
      distance $d$ into the block before it stops. Express all algebraic
      answers to the following in terms of $d$ and the given quantities
      previously indicated, as appropriate.}

      Now a new projectile and block are used, identical to the first

      block while the block slides across the table a short distance $D$.
      Assume the following: the projectile enters the block with speed
      $\varv_x$, the average force $F_b$ between the projectile and the block
      has the same value as determined in part (\ref{this}), the average force
      of friction between the table and the block is $f_T$, and the collision is
      instantaneous so the frictional force is negligible during the collision.
