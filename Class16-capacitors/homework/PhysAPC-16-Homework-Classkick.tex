  \question The figure above left shows a hollow, infinite, cylindrical,
  uncharged conducting shell of inner radius $r_1$ and outer radius $r_2$. An
  infinite line charge of linear charge density $+\lambda$ is parallel to its
  axis but off center. An enlarged cross section of the cylindrical shell is
  shown above right.

      conductor.
      \end{subparts}
    \part In the spaces below, rank the electric potentials at points $a$, $b$,
    $c$, $d$, and $e$ from highest to lowest (1 = highest potential). If two
    points are at the same potential, give them the same number.

    dimensions but is nonconducting and carries a uniform volume charge density
    $+\rho$. The infinite line charge, still of charge density $+\lambda$, is
    located at the center of the shell as shown above. Using Gauss's law,
    calculate the magnitude of the electric field as a function of the distance
    $r$ from the center of the shell for each of the following regions. Express
    your answers in terms of the given quantities and fundamental constants.

  \question A nonconducting, thin, spherical shell has a uniform surface charge
  density s on its outside surface and no charge anywhere else inside.
  \begin{parts}
    \part Use Gauss's law to prove that the electric field inside the shell is
    zero everywhere. Describe the Gaussian surface that you use.

    is no longer uniform. Is the electric field still zero everywhere inside the
    shell? Justify your answer.
