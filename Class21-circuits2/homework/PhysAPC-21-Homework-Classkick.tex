%  \question You have been hired to determine the internal resistance of
%  \SI{8.}{\micro\farad} capacitors for an electronic component manufacturer.
%  (Ideal capacitors have an infinite internal resistance---that is, the material
%  between their plates is a perfect insulator. In practice, however, the
%  material has a very small, but nonzero, conductivity.) You cannot simply
%  connect the capacitors to an ohmmeter, because their resistance is too large
%  for an ohmmeter to measure. Therefore you charge the capacitor to a potential
%  difference of \SI{10}{\volt} with a battery, disconnect it from the battery
%  and measure the potential difference across the capacitor every 20 minutes
%  with an ideal voltmeter, obtaining the graph shown above.
